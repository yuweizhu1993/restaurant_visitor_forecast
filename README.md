# restaurant_visitor_forecast
This is the group project for Data Mining course. Below is our brief project introduction
A. Motivation 
Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear.
There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.
One common predicament is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day
to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. This forecast isn't easy
to make because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, like weather and
local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little historical data.
Therefore, our team is interested in digging deeper into the issue of forecasting number of
visiting customers for restaurants on daily basis.
B. Data Overview
The dataset we plan to use includes selected data collected by a corporation called
Recruit Holdings, which has unique access to key datasets on some Japanese restaurants'
information.
C.  Data Source
The data that we will be using for this project was part of a prediction competition on
Kaggle. Specificly, the data is from multiple data sources including Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service)
, AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software)
D.  Data Structure
The data has multiple train sets and one test set. As mentioned above, the training dataset has multiple
data sources so we need to perform some data merging. The test dataset, on the other hand, has about
sixty thousand rows containing restaurant id and date as identification.
Note: Please down the html from gitlab rather than Canvas. The interactive map inside the html file sometimes cannot perform well if you download it from Canvas. Thank you.
